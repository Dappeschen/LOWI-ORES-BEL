# LOWI-ORES-BEL - Project Description

Last update: Dappeschen 202210301801

- connect to LOWI WIFI P1 dongle of ORES Belgium smart meter / digital elctricity meter
- via free test MQTT broker / server service test.mosquitto.org

Background / context
- my 'LOWI3-42' is a wireless data colector / transmitter, connected to the 'P1' port of my ORES smart meter / digital elctiricy meter
- the ORES meter is located atmy home in Wallonia, Belgium
- I have an electrical solar panel installation of 5kWp installed on my house's roof
- The solar panel installation was installed in February 2018
- The installatuion usually produces about 6MWh per year
- My typical overall electrical power consumtation is about 5,5MWh - with 4 family members
- The LOWI3 dongle is manifactured and sold by the belgium company Qonnex bva, in Aalst 
- The LOWI3 dongle is connected to my local WIFI / WLAN network
- I have external port forwarding set-up on my Proximus box / TPlink router for port 8082 - fowarded to the LOWI3 dongle
- I have a 'no IP' internet address: artware-solutions.zapto.org
- The LOWI3 dongle can be reached from the internet under artware-solutions.zapto.org:8082

Vision
- Help prosumers in Belgium to save and better manage energy

Objective
- Python-based data collection, storage and visualization

Desired Application Features 
- Simple web app for Windows operating system, - mobile app or adaptive design later
- Graphics / bar graphs to show real-time power [W] import from electricity distribution grid into house / export onto electricity grid, with history
- Logging / showing index evolution, including import - export net meter index [kmW]
- storing key data in data base, including with export to files in CSV or XLS format
- Personally NO focus on differentiation between 
	* High Tarrif: in Belgium usually applied - on demand / via special contract option - during work day time  
	and
	* Low Tarrif :	in Belgium usually applied - on demand / via special contract option - during nights, week-ends and official Belgian public Holidays
  This is because usually Belgian Prosumers - if choosing solar panals to produce electrical energy / no wind) do not choose such a 'bi-horaire' contract type, - as no production during nighht time period. 
  
- Key data
	P	Power [W]
	P = PI - PE - 'effective net' power for prosumer
		PI	Power Imported
		PE	Power Exported
	C	Counter / aka 'Index' [kWh]
	C = CH + CL
		CH	Counter index during high tarrif period
		CL	Counter index during low tarrif period
	Note: 
	- counter / index status pulled by electricty energy provider once a year in Belgium - for energy billing reasons (outside the scope of this project)
	- In southern part / region of Belgium / Wallonia: 
		* if more electrical energy (PE) generated by prosumer than imported (aka 'consumed'), then prosumer is not renumerated for this excess / delta.
		* if less electrical energy (PE) generated by prosumer than imported (aka 'consumed'), then prosumer is charged for this delta energie import.
